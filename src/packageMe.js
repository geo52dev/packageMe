//Part 1 - Instantiation

//Create an object literal called "myPackage" that has the following properties:
//a "height" of 100 units
//a "width" of 200 units
//a "length" of 250 units
//"numOfItems" which stores the number of items in the box
//"contents" an empty array which will contain the items of the package. 

//Extra Credit
//a function "changeHeight" => changes the package's height
//a function "changeWidth" => changes the package's length
//a function "changeLength" => changes the package's length
//a function "getVolume" => calculates and returns the package's volume


//Part 2 - Accessing values
//Using dot notation, add the property "color" and assign a string to it.
//Can you accomplish the same task using bracket notation??

//Using dot notation, add the property "serialNumber" and assign a number to it.
//Can you accomplish the same task using bracket notation?? 

var items = ["Calculators", "Rulers", "Math Textbooks"];

//Using whichever method, access "contents" of "myPackage" and update it with "items"
 
//Using whichever method, access "numOfItems" of "myPackage" and manually update it with how many "items" there are

//Add another item to the "contents" array called "Teddy Bear".


//Part 3 - Looping
//Using a proper loop (for or for-in??) log all KEYS of the object "myPackage"

//Using a proper loop (for or for-in??) log all items in the "contents"
